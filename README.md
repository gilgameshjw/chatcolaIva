# chatcolaIva


I am the code connecting IVA and Chatcola.

## CHATCOLA

A horriiiible technology because it doesn't store data... ( ~> **slavic/hunnic anarcho communism**).

## IVA

A beautiful multidimensional conversational/logic agent based on high dimensional computing, which is a neuro inspired technology using in combination symbolic logic and sparse vectors...

## Docker
